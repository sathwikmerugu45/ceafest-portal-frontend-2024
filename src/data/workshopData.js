        Eventdescription: `ETABS, short for Extended 3D Analysis of Building System, is a powerful software used by structural engineers to design and analyze buildings. Think of it as a virtual workbench where engineers create 3D models of structures, put them through various ${"stress tests"} including wind, earthquakes, and everyday use, and then optimize the design to be safe and efficient. It's like building a skyscraper in a computer, testing it for different scenarios, and refining it before ever laying the first brick.`,
